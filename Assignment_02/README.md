This code implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize task assignments for robots. It begins by generating a population of potential solutions, each representing a task assignment to robots. The fitness function evaluates solutions based on both total production time and workload balance among robots. Through tournament selection, individuals with the best fitness are chosen for reproduction, utilizing crossover and mutation to create offspring with potential improvements. This evolutionary process iterates over multiple generations to refine solutions. Finally, the code visualizes the best solution found, depicting task assignments on a grid considering task duration and priority. Overall, this approach efficiently allocates tasks to robots, considering various factors such as efficiency, duration, and priority, ultimately enhancing productivity and workload distribution.
